# Conference Planning Document

## Purpose

In the May 2, 2022 meeting, the working group agreed to explore the idea of holding a conference devoted to best practices for preparing R packages for CRAN. The goal would be to raise the quality of packages presented to CRAN with the hope of reducing the amount of work required by CRAN to test packages and communicate with package developers.

## Suggested Format 
* Online to encourage global participation
* Two or three days with sessions to cover multiple time zones
* Presentations by CRAN team members, experienced package developers, and experts on developing and maintaining repositories
Workshops including 1-1 help sessions


## Suggested Topics
* CRAN's mission
* The relation between CRAN and the R Core group
* CRAN's major features
* What is outside the scope of CRAN's work
* How CRAN works: Test systems, tests, automation, manual steps, experimentation, quality checks, manual procedures
* The interaction between CRAN and Bioconductor
* Is there room for additional repositories?
* A historical analysis of the major reasons packages are rejected by CRAN
* Should CRAN continue to accept all packages?
* Should there be more constraints on packages submitted to CRAN?
* What features should a modern R repository possess?
* Community expectations
* How can package developers help CRAN?
* Testing packages before submitting to CRAN
* What responsibilities do you have if your package is on CRAN?

## Conference Organization
The conference would be organized by the Repositories Working Group with the help of the R Consortium Marketing Committee.
