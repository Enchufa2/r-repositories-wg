This document briefly presents some questions this working group has discussed about CRAN to help it being successful.

 * CRAN does an amazing amount of work. What are the most critical issues that CRAN is facing?
 * CRAN has worked relatively similar for the first 20 years. What is the future of CRAN for the next 20 years?
 * There is some tension between packages' developers and users' interests respect to checks. What is the purpose of CRAN checks? 
 * What other are important aspects people should have in mind when volunteering to help CRAN?
 * Currently there are two repositories with agreements to avoid name conflicts, CRAN and Bioconductor. Would CRAN support the development of additional repositories along the lines of Bioconductor? What kinds of policies would that involve?
 * The CRAN team is very few people volunteering and lots of pressure. How could people and outside groups like us help?

Related to the last point this working group have been discussing several approaches:

 - Improve R-hub builder settings to match those on CRAN. ([minutes](https://github.com/RConsortium/r-repositories-wg/blob/main/minutes/2021-11-02.md))
 - Identify packages with intermittent failures because their tests are flaky and fail stochastically. ([website](https://llrs.github.io/intermittent_failures/))
 - Setting up infrastructure to automatically check repositories based on push and without reverse dependency checks. ([minutes](https://github.com/RConsortium/r-repositories-wg/blob/cb594603b50e0bbc77a8402e9b838f02737b8531/minutes/2022-01-04_Minutes.Rmd))
 - Consider making recommendations to users and packages developers about best practices for using CRAN. ([minutes](https://github.com/RConsortium/r-repositories-wg/blob/main/minutes/2022-02-01_Minutes.md))
 - Helping users and developers identify when packages are no longer maintained. ([issue](https://github.com/RConsortium/r-repositories-wg/issues/10))
 - Identify causes of packages being removed from CRAN. ([blog post](https://llrs.dev/post/2021/12/07/reasons-cran-archivals/))

We hope to find ways we can learn, help and interact with the CRAN team.
