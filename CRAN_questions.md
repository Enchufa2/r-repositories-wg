This document briefly presents some questions this working group has discussed about CRAN to help it being successful.

 * CRAN does an amazing amount of work. What are the most critical issues that CRAN is facing?
 * CRAN has been extraordinarily successful over its first 20 years; how can we ensure that its next 20 years are just as successful?
 * How can we help reduce the friction in CRAN/developer interactions?
 * Currently there are two repositories with agreements to avoid name conflicts, CRAN and Bioconductor. Would CRAN support the development of additional repositories along the lines of Bioconductor? What kinds of policies would that involve?
 * What are the opportunities for volunteers to help the CRAN team?
 * How could the community help CRAN?
 * We have several ideas on how to help CRAN. But to you, how can we best help you?
 We hope to find ways we can learn, help and interact with the CRAN team.
