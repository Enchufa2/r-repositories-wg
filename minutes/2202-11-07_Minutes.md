Those present discussed the draft of the google doc [CRAN Checks](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H41Jjuj6T7o7zdhe4mh2rPyIi76YkpnY4Jd48tBBy_Q/) which Hadley has prepared to summarize the WG's collective understanding of the CRAN check process inferred from the responses provided by multiple CRAN maintainers to the questions we sent to CRAN earlier this year. 

It was agreed that the easiest way to make progress would be to arrange a discussion with CRAN about the document.

**Action:** JBR agreed to try and arrange a meeting with CRAN within the next couple of weeks.

The next regular, monthly meeting of the WG will be at 8AM PST on Monday, December 5, 2022.
