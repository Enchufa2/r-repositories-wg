### R Validation Hub (JR)
https://www.pharmar.org / https://lists.r-consortium.org/g/RConsortium-Validation-Hub

* So far have been working on risk metrics package {riskmetric} + shiny app
* Now considering standing up a repository. Thinking about packages (and dependencies) that might be considered at the core of a clinical submission. Some discussion about how many packages this might be (estimates 75-400).
* Presumably will focus on CRAN packages, but might contain non-CRAN.
* Who would get to decide which packages appear in the repository? Don’t want to be gatekeepers. Could stand up a committee from community members. 
* Considering using ROpenSci infrastructure.
Opportunity for collaboration with us.

#### Questions/comments from us:

* JO: Encourage them to reach out to ROpenSci to discuss whether or not R-universe would be a good fit, or if there are additional features that R-universe could add to help.
* GB: How would they increment package versions? Clinical trials need to stay on same versions for multiple years, even as packages changing.
* MM: What did mango solutions do with their validated repository? Is it still an active project? (Mango was acquired by Ascent)
* HW: strongly advise to make a subset of CRAN. If not-first submission, generally accepted by a robot. If not a subset, what happens if a package is accepted by this repo, but not CRAN?
* WL: also challenges with proprietary packages. 

### Comments to CRAN (LR)

* Any feedback on https://github.com/RConsortium/r-repositories-wg/blob/main/CRAN_questions.md? Some (relatively) recent changes at https://github.com/RConsortium/r-repositories-wg/pull/11.

* Can we offer some concrete first steps? HW would love to start with the environment variables problem (so we can more accurately recreate check results).

* Have also been doing some data analysis of CRAN data (e.g. https://llrs.dev/post/2022/07/23/cran-files-1/) 

**Action Item**: JR and HW will draft a proposal to CRAN offering to assist with the process of publishing the environment variables and put it on the repo for comment.

The next meeting of the WG will be at 8AM Pacific Time on Monday September 5, 2022.
